abstract = {In this paper a Metaheuristic approach for solving the N-Queens Problem is introduced to find the best possible solution in a reasonable amount of time. Genetic Algorithm is used with a novel fitness function as the Metaheuristic. The aim of N-Queens Problem is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard, in a way so that no queen is in conflict with the others. Chromosome representation and genetic operations like Mutation and Crossover are described in detail. Results show that this approach yields promising and satisfactory results in less time compared to that obtained from the previous approaches for several large values of N.},
